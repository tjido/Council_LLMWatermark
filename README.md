# Council_LLMWatermark
This project seeks to embed a watermark feature into text generated by an LLM.

## Overview 
### ChatGPT-PDF Integration with Council.ai: Distinguishing LLM Output

This project focuses on the development of a sophisticated chatbot solution that can ingest PDF documents from your local drive, enabling queries using ChatGPT. A unique challenge is introduced: the necessity to differentiate content generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) from content originating in PDFs. To address this challenge, we'll harness the capabilities of the Council.ai package and framework. Our inspiration stems from Alistair Croll's work outlined in the Wired article ["To Watermark AI, It Needs Its Own Alphabet"](https://www.wired.com/story/to-watermark-ai-it-needs-its-own-alphabet/).

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`

## Getting Started
1. Install the required Python packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Download the 'msft-10K-2022.pdf' document as the PDF source for testing.
3. Configure the constants and inputs in the `main.py` script.
4. Run the script using `python main.py`.

## Implementation Details
The project involves the following main components:
- **PDF Ingestion:** The PDF document is ingested using the Council.ai framework, facilitating text extraction and processing.
- **Unicode Watermarking:** Inspired by Alistair Croll's approach, we employ Unicode characters as a watermarking mechanism to differentiate LLM-generated content from PDF content.
- **Chatbot Agent:** An AI agent is created using the Council.ai framework. It executes a process where chunks of text are processed, and messages are generated through various skills and chains.
- **Output Processing:** The output from the LLM is processed to highlight LLM-generated text and differentiate it from other content.

## Acknowledgments
We acknowledge Alistair Croll's pioneering work in watermarking AI-generated text with Unicode characters, as detailed in the Wired article ["To Watermark AI, It Needs Its Own Alphabet"](https://www.wired.com/story/to-watermark-ai-it-needs-its-own-alphabet/).

## Disclaimer
This project is experimental and is based on the principles outlined in the provided articles by Alistair Croll. The success of the Unicode chain method in distinguishing LLM output is a hypothesis we seek to validate through implementation and testing.

Feel free to contribute, collaborate, and explore new dimensions in AI transparency and recognition through Unicode watermarking.
