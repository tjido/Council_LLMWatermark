# Differenciating AI content from Human Content Using UNICODE VALUES

The Idea behind this Work is Motivated by this post: https://acroll.substack.com/p/all-you-need-is-unicode

### IDEA
Mark AI-written text with different Unicode values so that we can distinguish AI-written text from human-written text even though the letters look the same. Unicode works across all devices and websites, and doesnâ€™t need any changes to how people use the Internet. Plus, the people behind the Unicode governing body include many of the companies who are building Generative AI.

A world where we can tell the difference between human- and machine-generated content is better for humanity. We have labels for the things we put in our bodies; we should care as much about what we put in our minds. 

In this project, we are distinguishing between text from a human (PDF documents) and text from the LLM.


### Step to reproduce the code.

1. cd to chatbot repo `cd chatbot`
2. install requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. run `python main.py` on the terminal
4. After running the `main.py` file, the input will pop up.
    - enter pdf file name. eg: `msft-10K-2022.pdf`
    - enter company  name. eg: `Microsoft`
    - Query the pdf file: `How is the financial performance of Microsoft?`
5. The Output displays on the command line for both 
    - Hidden Unicode WaterMark AI Text
    - AI Output
    - Human Output

### Logic for the Unicode AI WaterMark 
Watermarking text using Unicode characters to differentiate between AI-generated and human-written content.

1. Embedding the Watermark: The embed_watermark function adds the hidden watermark to the original text. It works like this:
    - This function takes the original text and the watermark you want to hide. It goes through each character in the text:

    If the character is a letter, it adds the next character from the watermark followed by the letter itself. This hides the watermark within the text. If the character is not a letter (like a space or punctuation), it just adds the character as it is.

2. Revealing the Original text: The goal is to reveal the text from the watermarked text. Here's how the reveal_watermark_text function does it:

- This function goes through the watermarked text and checks each character:

    If the character matches the next watermark character, it means we've found a watermark character. So, we move to the next watermark character.
    If the character doesn't match, it's a regular letter, so we add it to the revealed text.
    
    This code uses the reveal_watermark function to extract the hidden watermark and prints the revealed text.
